# Churn-Modelling-using-Deep-Learning

 -Developed develop an accurate and efficient churn prediction model using deep learning 
 techniques (ANN). This involved analyzing historical customer data to identify patterns and 
 factors contributing to churn.

- Performed feature engineering to extract meaningful insights from the available data.
  
- Fine-tuned hyperparameters to enhance model accuracy and prevent overfitting.
